# Game Of Life

This is a client-side JavaScript version of Conway's Game of Life (CGoL). CGoL is a famous cellular automaton originally described by John Conway in 1970. You can check it from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life).

My implemention of GoL add more cool limites of parameters. It is uploaded to AWS as a webapp. You can check it and play around with it [here](http://gamehongkun.com.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/). Have fun!
